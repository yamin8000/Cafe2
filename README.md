# Cafe2 (WIP)
I recycled Cafe2 from an old project (Cafe) I worked on as a contractor.
Somehow the contract was voided so I decided to recycle the project.  
Originally App was architectured using simple Fragments with Navigation UI.
App saved data using the Room library in a local database.  
Cafe2 will utilities Jetpack Compose with MVVM architecture.  
More info will be added later
